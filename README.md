Formatted Cards with Hover Effect
This project demonstrates the creation of responsive, visually appealing cards with hover effects using UIkit and Franken UI. Each card contains a title, descriptive text, and a footer with a link. The cards are styled with custom CSS and include animations for a better user experience.


Features
- Responsive Design: The cards are arranged in a responsive grid layout, ensuring they look great on all screen sizes.
- Hover Effects: Cards slightly enlarge and add a shadow when hovered over, providing a smooth visual feedback.
- Consistent Styling: The cards maintain consistent styling with custom colors, fonts, and alignment.
- External Styles and Scripts: CSS and JavaScript are split into separate files for better organization and maintainability.


Technologies Used
- TML5: Markup language for creating the structure of the web page.
- CSS3: Custom styles for the cards, including hover effects and responsive design.
- UIkit: A lightweight and modular front-end framework for developing fast and powerful web interfaces.
- Franken UI: A modern UI toolkit for creating stylish and functional user interfaces.
